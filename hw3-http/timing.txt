Observations:
When using Keep-Alive, there was a consistent improvement in response times compared to using Connection: Close, which remained steady. 
This is likely because establishing a new connection for each request creates more work. 
Keep-Alive allows the same connection to be reused, saving time by avoiding the need for a new connection for each subsequent request.
